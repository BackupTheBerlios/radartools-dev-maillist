<PRE>ok, i played a bit around and put some support for plugins  inside of
rat. it was a nice change/relaxation after reading a lot of theory in
the last few weeks.
i already uploaded it, and also added two example plugins (which we
can delete later, for the release). so, after an update you will see
it working.
In general:
- plugins should be put into rat/plugins/ or .rat/plugins/ directories.
- the name should be &quot;rat_plugin_{MYNAME}.sav&quot; or &quot;rat_plugin_{MYNAME}.pro&quot;
- the included module(procedure) should be called &quot;rat_plugin_{MYNAME}&quot;
- it should be able to return a parameter &quot;PLUGIN_INFO&quot;, which should
have the structure: {menu_name:&quot;The name of the plugin as it should
appear in the menues&quot;, menu_pos:[&quot;positions inside the menu&quot;,&quot;at the
moment, only the menu-roots can be given, as sar, polsar,polinsar,
etc.&quot;]
- the menu_name-call will appear in all sub-menus, as specified in
menu_pos. Additionally, all plugins will be available in &quot;General-&gt;All
Plugins-&gt;&quot;. (For example, test-plugin will appear in &quot;polinsar-&gt;Extern
plugins-&gt;&quot;, and the quote-plugin will appear in &quot;polinsar-&gt;Ext. pl-&gt;&quot;
and in &quot;help-&gt;Ext. pl-&gt;&quot;. Both of them will appear in &quot;general-&gt;All
plugins-&gt;..&quot;)
- for the moment, to make it easier, I programed it so that the
plugins menues appear at the top of the sub-menues. if there will be
the need and the time, one can also describe the positions more
precise.

but just check it out, the description is more complicated than the
actual usage.
the plugin-file for quotes contains more info about plugin handling,
which should later be transported to tex and the rat-guide.
it's a proposal for this given task, and can be of course modified.

St&#233;phane, it sounds very good what you are doing!
If you want to rewrite the core-code, perhaps you can try to make it
hybrid? So that RAT can be used and modified as it is now, but also
using OOP modules (*). So that you can include changes continuously,
and everybody can continue to work on it, and slowly adapt.
Else it will be also a lot of work (and bugs!) to rewrite everything at once.
But I am especially waiting for the xml-parameter files!

(*) I think, well defined objects for rat-modules, together with
rat-graphics and rat-datahandling could make it really easy especially
for new rat developers to contribute, which could help to extend the
developers basis. but I am not sure, that it is that simple with idl.
what I mean is oop in the sense of C++/Smalltalk, and as far as I
looked inside, IDL is much less forthcoming (or not to say
inappropriate). but now I'm not that sure that I understood you
correctly, and I hope that you really meant Object Oriented
Programming, and not Object Graphics?
anyway, good luck!
