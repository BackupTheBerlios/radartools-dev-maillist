<PRE>Hi Andreas and All,

the &quot;save_image.pro&quot; I take on my account. I added channel_defaults
just a few days ago.
My problem was in connection with a script, which used Rat to generate
images of some rat files (or all in the directory), as well as of all
sub-tracks inside an MB-data set. And without the channel_defaults it
didn't update the channels when I used the extract-functions from the
shell.
Anyway, now I got the point, why it shouldn't be there. I'll remove it
(if nobody did it already), and I'll find (later) another way to get
my images without conflicts.

Concerning rrat, i want to mention that I added the feature to check
automatically for the &quot;.rat&quot; file endings. This is for the people who
prefer to save the time to write this ending explicitly.

Concerning the rat common block in rrat.pro: has to be removed, of
course. Just wanted to mention than in the given style it contains an
error source. With &quot;common rat, config&quot; one will not get the config
structure, but the first structure of the common block &quot;rat&quot;, which is
&quot;types&quot;. But it will be called &quot;config&quot; and will lead only to
confusion. The best way to use common blocks, is e.g. just to write
&quot;common rat&quot; without any other names, and one will automatically get
all the structures as defined previously with their defined names.

Regards,
Maxim

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was just scanning through the actual changes. I have some comments:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - rrat.pro: Some common blocks were added. This is not a good idea, because
</I>&gt;<i> rrat should be used also outside of rat on the command line to open rat
</I>&gt;<i> files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - save_image.pro: Calling channel_defaults (which was added) forces the
</I>&gt;<i> default settings. Therefore it is not written to the pixmap what is seen on
</I>&gt;<i> the screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Tisham: I dont know how you do that, but it is impossible to make a diff
</I>&gt;<i> with files you modified. There is always the entire old file with -tag and
</I>&gt;<i> the new one with +tag. Something in the setting of your editor is odd. We
</I>&gt;<i> should try to find out what. Do you use windows?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on the current status I'll prepare the 0.20 release. It will appear in
</I>&gt;<i> the svn soon. Then we should have a quick check if everything is o.k. and
</I>&gt;<i> release the whole stuff. The two points above I would prefer not to include
</I>&gt;<i> for the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Greetings &amp; keep hacking,
