<PRE>Hi Rat-Developers,

at first, thanks and congratulations for the new release.
Hope to see some of you somewhere around to have a beer with.
As it seems, there will be a lot of new functionality in the next version.
But at this point I want to share some ideas concerning improving the
infrastructure of Rat:

  1. Large files (&gt;2GB) bugs
  2. compile_opt functionality for less errors
  3. Auto-Docu a la doxygen for Rat
  4. Dev Docu - please contribute
  5. rat_scripts

1. Large files (&gt;2GB) bugs
Seems like now many people have datafiles &gt; 2GB, and in the last year
we got several bug reports because of this. Therefore we need to
adjust the available functions and to write the new ones correctly. In
general it relates to changing all file-pointer related variables to
LONG64, from LONG (or even from INT).

2. compile_opt functionality for less errors
I would recommend to use more often the &quot;compile_opt idl2&quot; statement
at the beginning of every function. The &quot;idl2&quot; option is an
instruction to the compiler to consider all written numbers
(automatically!) as longs (32bit, rather than ints with 16bit). This
saves some common errors e.g. in for loops. It has also to do with
large file bugs, since in some circumstances (e.g. loop over blocks),
the int-loop will do correctly over medium sized files, but will have
an overflow for very large files. Also &quot;idl2&quot; enforces square brackets
[] for array indices, and does  not allow usual brackets (), reserving
them only for functions. This helps the compiler to resolve possible
conflicts concerning function definitions (i.e. the compiler does not
mix anymore functions with array variables), and provides less
warnings/errors.
But when implementing this, check that everything works. In some
special cases this compile option might be undesired.
There are other compile options available, but none seem so profitable
as this one, and partly they are to restrictive.

3. Auto-Docu a la doxygen for Rat
We had a correspondence about it with Andreas, perhaps about half a
year ago. To develop documentation for RAT, for users and developers,
we should start to use an &quot;in-code&quot; documentation generator a la
doxygen (which belongs to any self-respecting software project). The
question is, which one to use. Final selection:
- IDLdoc: <A HREF="http://www.ittvis.com/codebank/search.asp?FID=100">http://www.ittvis.com/codebank/search.asp?FID=100</A>
- Robodoc: <A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~rfsber/Robo/robodoc.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~rfsber/Robo/robodoc.html</A>
- Natural Docs: <A HREF="http://www.naturaldocs.org/">http://www.naturaldocs.org/</A>
All of them have advantages and disadvantages. Recently (1-2 months
ago) IDLdoc 3.0 has been released under an open source license for the
first time, which makes it now quite competitive. And it seems like it
will be developed further. Therefore I would recommend this one. A
disadvantage of IDLdoc is that at the moment it generates only html
pages, an no pdf's, as e.g. robodoc can do. But I think, we can live
with it. What do you think? In case of a decision I offer to take care
of an initial setup and of providing a simple tutorial/template (as
soon as time will be available).

4. Dev Docu - please contribute
Please note that since some time we started to include more docu for
developers into the User's Guide. See Chapter 7:
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/radartools/trunk/doc/user_guide_v1.0.pdf">http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/radartools/trunk/doc/user_guide_v1.0.pdf</A>
Also, there are several tutorials on the homepage.
Since we all are quite scattered around the world (I believe, no two
of us are at the same place...), it's important to keep track of the
functionality of Rat, in the sense of infrastructure changes.
Therefore it would be nice to have more info/examples on different
aspects of Rat infrastructure (e.g. some examples on the usage of the
new tiling functions).
I think, we could split off the Dev's Guide from the User's Guide.

5. rat_scripts
With the last version, we provided the possibility to use external
plugins and scripts with Rat. Basic plugin templates can be found in
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/radartools/plugins/#_plugins">http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/radartools/plugins/#_plugins</A>_
Similarly, some example rat Scripts (partly representing stand alone
functions) should also be made available, e.g. in the rat_scripts svn
directory.

That's it for now.
Any comments welcome.

Regards,
Maxim
