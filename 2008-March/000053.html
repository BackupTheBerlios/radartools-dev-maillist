<PRE>Hi,

After having a beer with Maxim, we came to some conclusions I want to
communicate here:

Concerning the points already mentioned:

1) Large file support: Should be relatively easy to solve. In fact, with
the new tiling code, file pointers shouldn't be used explicitly. Older
routines (i.e. most routines) have to be adapted. The problem: A file
pointer returned by point_lun might be 32bit, even if the file is larger
than 2GB. This means that a cast to 64bit is _always_ necessary

2) compile_opt: we decided to use/add compile_opt with the keyword
&quot;idl2&quot; to all functions. The other possibilities would cause too many
problems. 

3) Autodocu: We decided for IDLdoc, which looks perfect for us and is
made for IDL. In future, all routines have to include an IDLdoc header
describing at least the keywords and the basic functionality. In fact,
this means also to add this header to old routines...

4) Dev Docu: Here no final solution has been found yet...

5) Scripts: Same problem. Maybe some more discussion is necessary.

In any case, we need to rework a bit the functions and to clean up the
code. To do so, Maxim and me decided to set up some RAT coding
standards. This will help to understand each other modules and to have
really a common framework and not this slightly chaotic mess we have
now. Certainly, this means to work  over at least the more important
routines. Let's hope we find the time...

More news soon...

Cheers,
Anderl
